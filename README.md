The poor man's "Infrastructure Health Analyzer" is the way I present this shit to my boss.

Frankly, I'm just learning Python and Git by reinventing the wheel.

### How to install:
```
git clone https://github.com/ivg313/pt-anal.git
cd pt-anal
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Now copy config.py.example to config.py and edit it as you needed.

### Test run
```
python3 py-anal.py
```
